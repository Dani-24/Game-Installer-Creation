## How to make an installer for your programs

There are tons of options to make your own installer. Some of them are: Creating your own code script, using Visual Studio, or (in our case) using programs that simplify our work as Inno Setup.

First of all you need to download [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and intall it on your computer.

Once you finished you need to prepare all the required files.

These are:
* The program executable file folder
* The program license in .txt format
* 2 .txts with the information you want to give to the user before and after installing your program
* 1 icon for your installer

If your files are prepared, now you can begin creating a new script file using Script Wizard in Inno Setup

This Script Wizard will help you to set up all your Installer, in the repository /docs folder you can find a [Tutorial .pdf file](https://github.com/Dani-24/Game-Installer-Creation/blob/main/docs/Game%20Installer%20Creation.pdf) where you could find a detailed tutorial with "To Do" for this Script Wizard, using the files from the repository [/Handout](https://github.com/Dani-24/Game-Installer-Creation/tree/main/handout) folder.

You can also check [/Solution](https://github.com/Dani-24/Game-Installer-Creation/tree/main/solution) files, where you will find the obtained setup.exe obtained from the tutorial and the Inno Setup Code file obtained when the Setup Wizard ends.
